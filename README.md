# Hello World!

I started with python about a couple of years ago, and yet everyday I seem to stumble upon something new or something more Python-ic. So I decided to put up all the new stuff I come across in a repostitory. This way I'll have some sort of a reference and maybe, it would come in handy for someone.

Thanks!
