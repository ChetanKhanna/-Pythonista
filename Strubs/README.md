# Strubs

Although nothing complecated here, its a nice way to make code more readable while still developing it.
Knowing them also helps in increasing readability.

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7620382/stubbing-out-functions-or-classes) link discusses some good methods for strubbing available in Python. Major ones being:

+ pass statement

+ raising NotImplemented error

+ `def func(*args, **kwargs) -> str : ...`

Thanks!
