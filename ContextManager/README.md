# Context Managers in Python

Just like decorators, python context managers are also widely used yet little understood.

Some references I used:
+ [Intro to context managers](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/03/07/python-with-context-managers/)
+ [Handling errros with context managers](https://alysivji.github.io/managing-resources-with-context-managers-pythonic.html)

Hope it helps!
